       " Document(id='aef003de-4bad-47bd-8536-5def97dcc9f5', metadata={'source': 'sample.txt'}, page_content='One of the key features of agentic AI is its ability to operate over long time horizons while maintaining awareness of its objectives. It can break down high-level goals into smaller sub-tasks, manage its progress, and learn from feedback or outcomes to improve performance. Agentic AI systems often combine various capabilities such as natural language processing, reasoning, memory, and planning. This allows them to not only interact with users in human-like ways but also to explore solutions, make informed choices, and even collaborate with other systems or agents when needed.'),\n",
       " Document(id='84a9b438-bbf7-4a45-9b7f-025984cb46ce', metadata={'source': 'sample.txt'}, page_content='The use of agentic AI is expanding across many domains, including virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and workflow automation. In business, it can streamline operations by acting as an intelligent co-worker, capable of managing tasks and adapting to new challenges. In education or healthcare, it can provide personalized support based on ongoing interaction and goal tracking. As the technology matures, agentic AI is expected to play a central role in the future of human-AI collaboration, offering more intelligent, reliable, and proactive assistance.\\nAnother important aspect of agentic AI is its ability to continuously learn and improve through interaction with its environment. These systems can adjust their behavior based on new information, experiences, or feedback without needing to be reprogrammed. This makes them particularly useful in dynamic settings where conditions change frequently, such as customer service, logistics, or smart home systems. By learning from past actions and outcomes, agentic AI can become more efficient and accurate over time, ultimately delivering better results with less human oversight.'),\n",

From managing daily tasks and making recommendations to running entire business processes or research projects, agentic AI has the potential to transform how we work and live. As it evolves, collaboration between humans and AI agents will become more natural and productive, leading to new possibilities in innovation, creativity, and problem-solving across various fields.')]"
